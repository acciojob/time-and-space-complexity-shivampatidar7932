	<h1>Time, Space, Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete, often denoted as O(f(n)), where f(n) is a function describing the algorithm's behavior. An efficient algorithm is one that achieves the desired result with minimal time complexity.
  </p>

  <p>
    Space Complexity is another critical aspect, indicating the amount of memory space an algorithm uses. It is often denoted as O(n), where n is the input size. <b>Space Complexity</b> is a crucial consideration in designing algorithms, aiming to optimize memory usage for better performance.
